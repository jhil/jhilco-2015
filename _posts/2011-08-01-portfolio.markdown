I have a tendency to change up my portfolio website about every year or so to reflect new design styles and experiment with fun ways to show off my work. My very first foray in web design was a portfolio site for JHil Media Design. JHil was my freelance firm, but also showcased my designs for pleasure. Over time, JHil Media Design phased out as I built up a more personal `jhil` brand.

Enter 2011 AD. Here is the first website I ever created. It's still live at [older.jhilmediadesign.com](http://older.jhilmediadesign.com).

This first website was hardcoded and static. I moved to a [Wordpress theme](http://themetrust.com/themes/hero/) to host my content. This V2 is still live at [old.jhilmediadesign.com](http://old.jhilmediadesign.com).

After this, I embarked on learning Wordpress and PHP to develop custom sites. Not only did this open a new channel of freelance business for me, but my new skills allowed me to design and develop my own CMS-powered portfolios. This last iteration of [jhilmediadesign.com](http://jhilmediadesign.com) is my one of my favorite sites. I mark this project as the beginning of my minimalist design aesthetic.

It's now 2013. I hit a point in my freelance business where I wanted to [focus on more personal projects](https://medium.com/i-m-h-o/build-your-own-dreams-yo-32102d680e61).

I began using `jhil.co` as my primary portfolio. This is my first take at it. This also marks my first attempt at JavaScript, where hovering over an element changes the header text to a project description. This was the coolest thing ever! Check out [older.jhil.co](older.jhil.co).

I wanted my portfolio to really say something. At that point, it only said that my favorite color is yellow. After experimenting a tad with personal branding, [I settled on something I liked](https://dribbble.com/shots/1444745-JHIL).

I even built out an entire typeface in this style, but [thankfully] never actually used it beyond the `j` `h` `i` and `l` characters.

The associated jhil v2 website exhibited a deeper exploration in JavaScript, by changing the background color as the cursor moved around. The immediate feedback was that this was "seizure-inducing," but I thought it was an interesting effect that I wanted to continue playing with.

I also began learning how to use CSS animations. I prototyped a website intro that started by saying `HI`, then `JHIL`. [old.jhil.co](http://old.jhil.co/) (then, just jhil.co of course) was released in July 2014 and still stands live as one of my favorite playground projects.

This was cute and friendly, but I knew it wouldn't last long due to its experimental nature and lack of clarity or flow. In October 2014, I created this site for the start of the new schoolyear. It is the most thorough out of all my projects, with project descriptions and a more mature set of portfolio items. I learned how to use [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), the stripped-down reincarnation of what I always wanted Wordpress to be. I also used [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) for the first time, dramatically improving my workflow. And now this, [jhil.co](http://jhil.co) (you're already here).
