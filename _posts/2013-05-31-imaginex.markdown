Over the years, I've had the pleasure of working with [Eric Mintzer](https://twitter.com/ericmintzer) and the Imaginex team on a number of projects. We met through [Startup Shell](http://startupshell.org) and continue to learn from each other to this day. With my unofficial role as "Doctor Professor Lawyer," we've built an incredible brand, created exciting videos, and built slick websites for the company.

## The Company

Imaginex is a creative technology studio that produces immersive, multi-sensory experiences. Companies hire Imaginex for their most challenging projects and entrust their budgets in the team's wide expertise: from projector mapping to lighting, from software to fabrication.

## Brand

At the time, the company name was [stylized as `imagine(x)`](https://umddingman.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/imaginex.jpg). In an effort to make the brand more timeless, we quickly adjusted the capitalization and punctuation to `Imaginex`. We also settled on the tagline "Creative Reality" to suggest the idea that the Imaginex vision is not limited by the traditional constraints of our physical world.

## Logo

We wanted the new Imaginex logo to be edgy and futuristic without coming off too plastic. The typographic approach was inspired by the perentheses used in the previous logo, meant to reflect `function(x)` syntax.

I created a bumper animation that connected the full logo with the `[X]` icon and features the "Creative Reality" tagline.
