I am a member of [QUEST (Quality Enhancement Systems & Teams)](http://www.rhsmith.umd.edu/programs/undergraduate-programs/academics/fellows-special-programs/quest) at the University of Maryland. As part of the program, we take a Junior year course in systems thinking and work on a project that ties together our learnings in idealized design and process improvement.

I teamed up with [Zach Lawrence](#) and [Peter Weng](#) to build Feelwheel, a steering wheel that delivers haptic feedback to drivers.

Our key observation was that even when drivers were distracted, their hands usually still touching the steering wheel.

We want to take advantage of this behavior to alert drivers with targeted vibrations through the steering wheel. This sensory approach renders reflexive actions from the driver for near immediate response time. Applications of this technology include...

- alerting drivers of front or rear obstacles while driving or parking using external distance sensors
- providing navigation by vibrating the left or right section of the wheel
- educating student drivers with built-in curriculum
- buzzing while speeding to reduce reckless driving

Here is a quick video of our Arduino prototype in action, demonstrating the parking aid feature. The steering wheel attachment vibrates intermittently once within range of the front obstacle. The frequency of buzzes increases as I pull in, finally vibrating continuously when in optimal position. This helps me navigate my car into this parking spot without bumping into the wall in front of me, a task that was previously performed based on blind instinct.
