Ah, Facetoaster...

At MHacks Winter 2014, I grouped up with [Luis Santos](#) and Jared "Glove" Glover to make Facetoaster. The idea for this hack was to create a beautiful tool helps people understand the differences between design iterations.

For the complete Facetoaster story, I recommend reading my Medium post: ["FACETOASTED: Reflections from MHacks / On dev, product, beauty from the Michigan hackathon"](https://medium.com/@jhilmd/facetoasted-reflections-from-mhacks-5a718169b6b)

We quickly went from mockup...

... to prototype.

I also had a blast making the Facetoaster logo and fashion line.

UPDATE: _Now that I know Ruby on Rails, I'd like to convert Facetoaster from its current static proof-of-concept page into a functioning web app. In time..._
