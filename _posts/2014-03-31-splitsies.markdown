## Current Situation
 
Splitting bills ain’t fun. It’s slow and awkward to figure out who owes whom how much… and when and in what denomination… and so on. The end of a dinner should be for socializing on a full stomach and appreciating the wonderful last hour spent with friends or family.
 
All too often this time is committed to breaking out the calculators to work out the line-item expenditures, leaving all parties in a state of perpetual confusion and favor asking. Most of the time, despite all efforts, a group will beg a waiter to prepare separate checks or someone ends up throwing in and extra $20 “just to be done with it.”
Several bill splitting tools exist, but none attack this core problem of slow transactions. Most apps seem to focus on accuracy not speed, with half-baked receipt scanning features and gimmicky UIs. See for yourself: https://play.google.com/store/search?q=bill%20splitter
 
## Solution
 
Splitsies is a no-frills approach to splitting bill that is designed for speed. One designated payee covers the table’s bill, divides the total up on the app, and collects payment from others in the group. The central interaction is in a graph of each person’s portion of the total bill, represented by adjustable bars.
For example, if four people go out for milkshakes, and only Beth gets a pricier “Deluxe Megashake,” McKinley can just input the total bill and then pull up Beth’s bar accordingly.
By connecting with Facebook, users can easily charge directly to Venmo, or alternatively, an amount can be paid out in cash.
 
## Audience & Behaviors
 
This app is aimed at users who go out with a group of friends on a regular basis. Each transaction will not exactly match the correct line item amount per person, but over time these numbers will average out amongst friends. Plus, when you’re already a few drinks in, it’s hard to care about an extra buck here and there. The Splitsies method is not for everyone, but is a quick, easy, and fun tool for those willing to give it a try.
 
## Scene
 
Splitsies was inspired by apps like Level and Robinhood. These are financial tools that simplify daunting tasks that have previously required more infrastructure. While this minimalist approach limits functionality, it consolidates the user experience to be useful and focused.

## Process
 
Here is the breakdown of project time over the course of two days. Research and brainstorming, 2 hours; observation, 1 hour; wireframing, 30 minutes; design and mockups, 6 hours; animation, 8 hours; presentation and final touches, 1 hour.
 
“Observation” involved me going to Maryland’s Cornerstone Grill with three friends to experience a bill splitting situation while consciously paying attention to the interactions. Here, I saw the lack of care paid to the different items on the receipts, and overall cumbersomeness as my friends fumbled for their wallets. It was interesting to see my friends ask how much others were putting in and how that influenced their payments. This inspired the group-focused, ratio-based approach to bill splitting as seen in Splitsies.
