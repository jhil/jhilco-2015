In the Fall 2014 semester, I enrolled in ARCH470: Architecture Technology. I had already taken a couple introductory architecture courses, but this would be my first advanced class on the topic. In ARCH470, I completed a series of assignments that actively used the curiculum's software as I learned it. These tools included Rhinoceros, Grasshopper, V-Ray, Revit, Photoshop, 3ds Maxx, and SketchUp.

The projects below are composed of presentation boards, highlighted assets, and maybe a process picture or two. The descriptions are pulled directly from the boards.

## Final Project

Sites like warehouses, factories, and farms are often repurposed for programs more appropriate for their locations. This project explores how a barn would be designed if it’s focus was coworking from the outset.

The barn was modeled parametrically in Grasshopper, using points from sine curves of various amplitudes to construct the distinct “double gambrel” roof.

The barn provides public and private, indoor and outdoor, work and lounge spaces. The bottom floor contains the main coworking environment while the upper level includes a lounge and library. The outdoor walkway connects the two second-floor rooms and provides a scenic overlook.

## Assignment 3: Visualization

Washington, D.C. promotes its ability to juggle culture and politics. In this assignment, I created a pavilion to match the city’s unique behaviours, serving as both a venue and a passive leisure site. The structure’s tesselating layers are suitible for a rally, concert, or lecture, providing optimal vantage points for 200 people. When not in scheduled use, tourists and locals can relax on the pavillion steps, unobtrusive to everyday happenings on the National Mall.

The pavilion’s wide podium targets its energy at the provided seating, but has the opportunity for expansion in the open area. Each step is accessible, though the far side has small elevated levels to accomodate photographers and other special situations. This design is parametric, able to expand outward with more levels or adjust the height interval and detail of the interior pattern.

## Midterm: Capturing Process

This assignment revolved around the Grasshopper plugin for Rhino. While it can be used to create a boundless number of structures, I was particularly interested in its data analysis tools.

Using the Elk’s site mapping tools, I set out to fuse New York’s iconic streetmap and buildings with San Fracisco’s notoriously hilly topography. Elk employs OpenStreetMap.org and Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) data from NASA, so this model simulates this concept with real data.

This project had several iterations. First, I pulled the NYC street data and planned to place it atop a randomly generated hill. Then I learned that Elk can support topography data, too. Later, I played with sliders to randomly generate building heights until my model looked similar to the NYC skyline.

## Assignment 2: Digital to Physical

In Assignment 2, we use paneling tools in Rhino to create unique experiences, considering the digital tools and physical prototyping that go into different structures. Inspired by observatories, helments visors, and the Death Star, this dome plays with light and dark to allow for different uses throughout the day. The outer skin has a pin that allows it to rotate around the inner skin, strategically revealing or hiding what is underneath. This structure is 3D printed to ensure rigidity and precision of the pin mechanism.
